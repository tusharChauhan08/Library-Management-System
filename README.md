# Library-Management-System
Library management web application is fully responsive web application.
This application manage all the details like issue the book and submit the book and all the details about the book which is available in the library.
I use the django for this project and for the backend i use the mongodb.
I use also session for the better performance of the site and for the security of website and the user from the unauthorised access to the data.
